# Thai Red Curry

## Ingredients

- 1 small 4 oz can Thai red curry paste (Maesri is a good company)
- 1 cup (8 oz) coconut cream (not milk)
- 1 15 oz can coconut milk
- 1 5 in piece lemongrass
- 1 clove garlic
- 1 3 in knob of crushed galangal
- 2 kaffir lime leaves
- Lime juice, fish sauce, and salt (for finishing the curry at the end)

## Instructions

1. In a sauce pot, add the coconut cream and reduce over medium-high heat until it breaks and the oil separates. It should look like melted marshmallows, smell sweet and toasty, and appear coagulated.
2. Add the can of curry paste to the reduced coconut cream and whisk until the cream re-emulsifies.
3. Reduce the curry mixture again until it separates and coagulates, with an oil slick on top.
4. Add the can of coconut milk and whisk until the curry re-emulsifies and looks normal again.
5. Add the galangal, lemongrass, garlic, and kaffir lime leaves to the pot and simmer for 20 minutes until thickened.
6. Add your choice of meat and/or vegetables to the curry and cook until tender and cooked through. Keep in mind that the curry will naturally thicken as it cooks, so add the meat or vegetables accordingly.
7. Once the meat and/or vegetables are cooked and the sauce has reached the desired consistency, remove the pan from the heat.
8. Add a few splashes of fish sauce, a good squeeze of lime, and a dash of salt to the curry, tasting as you go until the desired flavor is reached.
9. Remove the lemongrass, galangal, and kaffir lime leaves before serving.
10. Serve the Thai red curry with your choice of accompaniments, such as rice or noodles, and enjoy!
